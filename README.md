# Table1PKG
PHC 6068, Fall 2022, Final project R package to create Table 1 summary

Description: Creates a rough summary table that should be readable enough to share as a preliminary 
step when discussing with researchers. Numerical variables will have mean, median, and counts while 
categorical variables will have contingency tables. Two columns on the right will show the parametric 
and non-parametric p-values for a test of differences. Parametric p-values will come from an ANOVA test 
for numerical variables and a Chi-square test for categorical variables. Non-parametric p-values will 
be from a Kruskal-Wallis test for numerical variables and Fisher's Exact test for categorical variables.
